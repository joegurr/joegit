I wanted to learn more about how the internals of git worked, for me the best way to do that was to try and build a subset of the features.

I found this [amazing tutorial](https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/#). The code in this repo is my interpretation of this tutorial (it is mostly the same, but in some small ways I have tweaked it to make it my own).
